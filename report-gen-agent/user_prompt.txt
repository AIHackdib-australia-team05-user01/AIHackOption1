You need to create a report about Vendor One.

The template for the report looks like this:
'''
# Test Report

## Support

| Item | Info | 
|---|---|
| Support | <suport info> |
| Training | <training info> |
'''.

You need to find all the arrow brackets like this <> and enter the correct data into that place.
Don't add any extra info to the report, only fill in the placeholders.
The info for the placeholders will come from the response data in the database.
Show me what the report will look like.
